This is a collection of programs I have been writing to run on My NanoPi Fire3 board.
These are bare metal programming or research projects

This board is based on the Samsung s5p6818 chip.

1. Blink32 - tiny standalone program to blink onboard LED in A32 mode
1. Blink64 - small standalone program to blink onboard LED in A64 mode
1. Boot1 - disassemble the "bl2" boot loader distributed with Linux
1. Boot_NSIH - disassemble the header that jumps from A32 to A64
1. Bootrom - disassemble the s5p6818 on-chip boot loader
1. USB_loader - host side (linux) tool to download code via USB.

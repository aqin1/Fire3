Read out and disassemble the Stage 1 bootloader for the Samsung S5P6818

This begins with the file bl1-mmcboot.bin, which I found in
the sd-fuse_s5p6818/prebuilt for the NanoPi Fire3

The file bootrom.txt is the final product and probably what you
want to look at.

This is part of my attempt to understand the details
of how my NanoPi Fire3 board boots.

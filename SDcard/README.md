If you are itching to do some bare metal programming on
the NanoPi Fire3, here are binaries to get your started.

The easiest way is to use "make img" to put a working
image with uboot onto a blank sd card.  This will try
to do dhcp and then tftp an image called fire3.bin.
You will need to set up the necessary servers on your
linux machine.

Other things are possible.  See the Makefile.

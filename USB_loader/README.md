USB_loader

This is a host side program to download code to a NanoPi Fire3 or M3 board
over a USB cable.  To use it, remove any SD card from the board and power it
via a USB cable, which will also be used for the download from the linux host.

This can download verbatim files, or add a header for either 32 bit or 64 bit code.
Details are in a long comment in the source file.
